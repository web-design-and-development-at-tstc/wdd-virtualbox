## Install Apache on Ubuntu

It is always a good idea to get in the habit of updating the package manager before installing new software.  Open the terminal and run the command `sudo apt-get update` and let it finish updating.

To install Apache on Ubuntu, run the command `sudo apt-get install apache2` and type `Y` to give confirmation to install.

It will take a few minutes for everything to install.

## Verify Apache Installation

To verify Apache was installed correctly, open up a web browser on your host machine or another computer on your local network and type in the address bar the IP address for your virtual machine.  You should see a page labeled “Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page” as seen in the image below.
